Hi. Welcome back. After more than 6 months of inactivity, I've finally made a new reposiitory.
Here, we are using Replit, which requires and account. I am going to mainly use Python for this but I will attempt at Java, Pygame, HTML, and Turtle with Pyhon.
I will try to paste the pictures, but if dosen't works, I will copy and paste the code.
My Repl.it account name is KumarAakarsh if you to you want to view my programs(I fail somtimes).
